    You can get called when reachability changes by either KV-observing the properties, or setting
   an "onChange" block.
    "Reachable" means simply that the local IP stack has resolved the host's DNS name and knows how
   to route packets toward its IP address. It does NOT guarantee that you can successfully connect.
   Generally it just means that you have an Internet connection. */
